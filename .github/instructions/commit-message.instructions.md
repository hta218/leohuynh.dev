## Git Commit Message Guidelines

- Write a clear and concise description of the code, including its purpose and functionality.
- Make sure to include any important details or context that would help someone understand the code.
- Make the commit short and descriptive, summarizing the changes made in a few words.
- Always use conventional commit message formats like "fix", "feat", or "chore".
