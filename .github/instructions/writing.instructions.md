## Writing Instructions

- ALWAYS KEEPING THINGS SIMPLE!
- Use simple English, direct language, avoiding complex jargon.
- Write in spoken language, as if explaining to a friend.
- Use short sentences and paragraphs for clarity.
- Write in a friendly and approachable tone.
- Humor is welcome, but keep it appropriate (no offensive jokes or too much sarcasm).
- Use emojis to add a friendly touch, but don't overdo it.
- Titles and headings should be clear and descriptive, make theme short but enough to grab readers' curiosity.
- Make the articles human-like writing, not AI-generated.
- Ending an article with a friendly note or call to action, like "Happy coding!" or "Thanks for reading!".
