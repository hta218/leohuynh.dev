# Terminal Interface

A beautiful, interactive terminal interface for exploring Leo's personal data and blog content.

## Architecture

The terminal is built with a modular architecture for better maintainability and reusability:

### Core Components

- **`Terminal` Component** (`terminal.tsx`): Core terminal logic for command execution and content display
- **Command System** (`command-executor.ts`, `commands.ts`): Extensible command structure with categories
- **Theme System**: Consistent theming across all terminal components

### Supporting Components

- **`suggestion.tsx`**: Command suggestion display with keyboard navigation
- **`font-selector.tsx`**: Font selection dropdown
- **`theme-selector.tsx`**: Theme selection dropdown  
- **`blog-viewer.tsx`**: Modal blog post reader
